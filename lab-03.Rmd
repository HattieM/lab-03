# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```

The bars aren't in proportion to the number of speakers of each language (e.g. spanish and enlgish bars are similar in size but english has 300 million more speakers)





## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

All in black and white, no numbers, representing two different pieces of data but its not clear what is representing what in the diagram 




## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```

_Write your comments about image 3 below_

No title so its unclear what the graph is showing, Has no key so we don't know why the balls are different sizes and colours, axes doesn't have a scale, Graph should maybe be larger/more spread out so the data is more clear 



## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")
```

_Write your comments about image 4 below_

Y-axis label isn't clear, not clear how the graph is supposed to be read, X-axis scale isn't evenly spaced


# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?


Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?


How many observations are there in the data set?




## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

#staff_long <- ___ %>%
#  ___(
#    cols = ____, 
#    names_to = "_____",
#    values_to = "percent"
#    )

```


## Exercise 3
